                    <h1 id="FirmwareJIRAGuide-WhatisJIRA?">What is JIRA?</h1><p>JIRA is the team's issue and project management system. For the firmware subteam we mostly use it to keep track of what issues are being worked on, by who and the status of those issues.</p><h1 id="FirmwareJIRAGuide-ProgressColumns">Progress Columns</h1><h2 id="FirmwareJIRAGuide-ToDo">To Do</h2><p>The to do column is the beginning stage of any issue. This is where issues are placed before investigation and before any code progress has begun. As soon as any progress is made on an issue it should be moved to the In Progress column</p><h2 id="FirmwareJIRAGuide-InProgress">In Progress</h2><p>The In Progress column covers issues that are currently being worked on. Any issue that is being worked on for an extended period of time should be moved here. This is where most issues should reside. When a PR is made the issue should be moved to the Code Review column. If the issue is being abandoned/no work is being done by the current user it should be moved back into To Do.</p><h2 id="FirmwareJIRAGuide-CodeReview">Code Review</h2><p>The Code Review column covers all the issues that currently have active PRs or need to be tested. When a PR is created the issue should be moved to this column. If in code review it comes out that a non trivial change must be made to the PR's code then the issue should move back to In Progress. An issue will only progress to the Done column when the PR has been approved by all reviewers and rigorous testing has been completed.</p>
