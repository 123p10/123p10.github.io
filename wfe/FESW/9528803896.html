<h1 id="BMU(BatteryManagementUnit)-MonitoringCellVoltageandTemperatures">Monitoring Cell Voltage and Temperatures</h1><p>An important part of managing the high voltage battery on the car is monitoring the individual cell voltage and temperatures of the high voltage battery pack. The battery is composed of a number of individual cells connected in parallel and series to achieve the voltage and capacity requirements of the battery. For more information on the cells, see <a href="https://uwaterloo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FEAM/pages/6090887483/Accumulator+Cell+Selection" data-linked-resource-id="6090887483" data-linked-resource-version="33" data-linked-resource-type="page">this page</a> in the accumulator space, or the accumulator space as a whole. In our battery, the cells are lithium ion cells, which have a number of safety hazards associated with them that require careful management. The attached document below outlines many of the risks, but from the BMU's perspective the key risks are in managing the voltage and temperature of the cells. Too high or too low a voltage or temperature can cause significant hazards, so these conditions must be avoided.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="attachments/9528803896/9567702056.pdf" data-nice-type="PDF Document" data-file-src="/wiki/download/attachments/9528803896/Li-ion-safety-July-9-2013-Recharge-.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1588077260383&amp;cacheVersion=1&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="9567702056" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="9528803896" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Li-ion-safety-July-9-2013-Recharge-.pdf" data-mime-type="application/pdf" data-has-thumbnail="true" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-media-id="1e769103-3b69-4f69-8090-6ea220dc7c21" data-media-type="file"><img src="attachments/thumbnails/9528803896/9567702056" height="250"/></a></span> </p><p><br/></p><p>In order to monitor the cell temperature and voltages, the BMU communicates with the Accumulators Measurement System (AMS) boards in the battery pack over isoSPI (an electrically isolated version of the SPI interface, see the LTC6811 datasheet for more info). Each AMS board is connected to a number of cells, and can be commanded to measure their temperature and voltage. </p><p><br/></p><h2 id="BMU(BatteryManagementUnit)-2018-2019-2020AMSBoards">2018-2019-2020 AMS Boards</h2><p>The 2019-2020 AMS boards use the LCT6804/LTC6811 battery monitoring chips (the 6811 is just a newer version of the chip with identical interface). The datasheet for the 6811 is linked on this page. Since the number of cells each LTC chip can monitor is less than the total number of cells in the battery pack, multiple AMS boards are used each with their own LTC chip. In order to communicate with all the AMS boards, the BMU is connected to them over isoSPI in a daisy chain configuration. This means the BMU is connected to the first AMS board (the AMS board's LTC chip) over isoSPI, then the first AMS board is connected to the second AMS board over isoSPI, and then each additional AMS board is connected to the previous AMS board over isoSPI. In order to communicate with the AMS boards, the BMU sends out a command over isoSPI which gets sent to all the AMS boards, then they turn into a shift register to shift in or out data to/from the AMS boards. For example, to read back the cell voltages, the BMU sends a command to tell the AMS boards to  read cell voltages, then performs an isoSPI read with size equal to all the cell voltages measured by the daisy chain. Then each board in the daisy chain will send its measurements onto the previous board who sends it onto its previous board etc, thus the measurements will reach the BMU. </p><p>The driver for the LTC6811 chips is implemented in the ltc6811.c and ltc6811.h files.</p><h3 id="BMU(BatteryManagementUnit)-TemperatureMeasurement">Temperature Measurement</h3><p>In order to measure the temperature of the cells thermistors are used, which are measured by the AMS boards. Each cell has a thermistor connected to it, which is in turn connected to a multiplexer (mux). The multiplexer is then connected to one of the GPIO pins on the LTC chip, which is capable of acting as an ADC input. The other GPIO pins on the LTC chip are connected to the select pins on the multiplexer to allow selecting which thermistor to measure.</p><p><span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Reading a cell temperature comprises setting the LTC GPIO pins to select the correct mux input for that cell, then performing an ADC read on the LTC GPIO pin connected to the mux output. The thermistor voltage for that cell can then be read back. Next, the thermistor voltage must be converted to a temperature. This is done use the specifications on the thermistor datasheet, which specify the thermistor resistance at different temperatures. The thermistor is connected as part of a resistor divider, so based on the second resistor value and supply voltage the resistance of the thermistor modulates the output voltage to the LTC chip. Next, the voltage is converted to a temperature. Typically, a polynomial is fitted to the </span></span>voltage (based on resistance and supply voltage) vs<span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"> temperature values from the thermistor datasheet, which can be then used to convert from voltage to temperature. This is done on the BMU. For examples of converting voltage to temperature, see this project <a href="Thermistor-Voltage-to-Temperature-Polynomial-Regression_9556066929.html" data-linked-resource-id="9556066929" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">page</a> for the 2020 thermistors.</span></span></p><h3 id="BMU(BatteryManagementUnit)-Openwirecheck">Open wire check</h3><p>A feature of the LTC chip is to perform an open wire check. This checks if the AMS board is actually connected electrically to all the cells it is supposed to be measuring. If a connection breaks or comes loose, then this check will fail. This check is run periodically as part of the cell monitoring process.</p><p><br/></p><h3 id="BMU(BatteryManagementUnit)-CellvoltageFiltering">Cell voltage Filtering</h3><p>In order to remove noise present in the AMS cell voltage readings, the cell voltages are filtered before being used for safety checks. The logged cell voltages over CAN remain unfiltered. It is believed the noise is due to vibrations from the motors spinning causing bad contact with the pogo pins between the cells and the AMS boards. It may also be due to EMI from the motor controllers.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="attachments/9528803896/9567702058.pdf" data-nice-type="PDF Document" data-file-src="/wiki/download/attachments/9528803896/ltc6811.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1588078115543&amp;cacheVersion=1&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="9567702058" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="9528803896" data-linked-resource-default-alias="ltc6811.pdf" data-mime-type="application/pdf" data-has-thumbnail="true" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-media-id="bc011194-c230-48bd-a07f-8731123243e7" data-media-type="file"><img src="attachments/thumbnails/9528803896/9567702058" height="250"/></a></span></p></div>

<h1 id="BMU(BatteryManagementUnit)-ContactorControl">Contactor Control</h1><p>In order to safely connect the high voltage battery to the motor controllers, the electrical system uses contactors. The contactors electrically connect the battery positive and negative terminal to the motor controllers positive and negative terminal. Similar to a relay, they are electrically controllable, allowing the connection to be opened and closed. As well, they are normally open, meaning that they require current flow through their control terminals to remain closed. See <a class="external-link" href="https://www.springercontrols.com/news/contactors-vs-relays/" rel="nofollow">these</a> <a class="external-link" href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/digital/chpt-5/contactors/" rel="nofollow">pages</a> for more info.</p><p>A key function of the contactors on the car is to safely disconnecting the motor controllers from the battery in the case of a fault. This disconnection of the motor controllers and battery is part of a key safety system on the car. Both the firmware and the electrical system will open the contactors in the event of a fault, thus disconnecting the the battery from the motor controllers, and isolating the high voltage inside the battery box. For more information on this safety system, it is recommended to read the ESF, in particular the sections 3: Safety Circuit, 11: AMS, 12: Accumulator and Container.</p><p>Another function of the contactors is to safely connect the battery to the motor controllers. This is done in a controlled manner, as the large capacitance of the motor controllers would lead to a very large current flowing through the contactors if they were both closed at the same time. Therefore, a precharge procedure is used to slowly charge up the capacitors in the motor controllers, limiting the current flow. This is done with an additional relay (often referred to as a contactor, although it is technically a relay) called the precharge discharge relay (PCDC relay), as well as a power resistor. In order to precharge the motor controller, one of the contactors is closed, and the precharge relay connects the precharge resistor across the other contactor, thus allowing current to flow into the motor controllers through the resistor, where the resistor limits the current flow. Once the motor controller is at the same (or almost the same) voltage as the battery, then the other contactor is closed. For more information on precharge, see ESF section 13: Precharge Discharge. Related to the precharge procedure is the discharge procedure. This uses the PCDC relay and resistor to discharge the motor controllers once the contactors are open. If this was not done, then the capacitance of the motor controllers would mean that even once the contactors are open and the battery disconnected, the motor controllers would retain a high voltage across their terminals. Again, see ESF section 13: Precharge Discharge for more info.</p><p>Because the contactors form such an essential part of the safe operation of the car, it important to verify that they are functioning correctly before running the car. A common failure mode of contactors is that they become welded closed due to the high currents that can occur when they are incorrectly operated, thus they fail closed. As well, they can also fail open. Therefore, as part of the precharge procedure, a series of tests are performed to test wether either of the contactors or the PCDC relay have failed (either open or closed). If a failure is detected, the precharge procedure is aborted and an error raised. Rather than re-document these tests, again refer to ESF section 13: Precharge Discharge for more info. As well, a pdf document is attached below which outlines the test procedure.</p><p>The control of the contactors, as well as the precharge tests, are done in the prechargeDischarge.c and prechargeDischarge.h files.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="attachments/9528803896/9567702310.pdf" data-nice-type="PDF Document" data-file-src="/wiki/download/attachments/9528803896/Contactor%20FMEA.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1588164556233&amp;cacheVersion=1&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="9567702310" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="9528803896" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Contactor FMEA.pdf" data-mime-type="application/pdf" data-has-thumbnail="true" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-media-id="b7f8bf3f-77f3-440a-bd8a-ec93fa925bf9" data-media-type="file"><img src="attachments/thumbnails/9528803896/9567702310" height="250"/></a></span></p></div>

<h1 id="BMU(BatteryManagementUnit)-Charging">Charging</h1><p>The BMU is also responsible for managing the charging of the cells of the high voltage battery. It does this with the help of the AMS boards (explained above), and the high voltage charger (documented as part of the charger controller board <a href="https://uwaterloo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FEEL/pages/6524676373/2018+Charger+Controller+Unit" data-linked-resource-id="6524676373" data-linked-resource-version="92" data-linked-resource-type="page">here</a>). The charge process involves coordinating a few tasks.</p><p>First, in order to charge the battery needs to be connected to the charger. This requires mechanically connecting the battery to the charger, but also going through the precharge procedure to close the contactors and electrically connect the battery to the charger. As shown in the state machine diagram, there is a minor change in the precharge tests when connected to the charger, as the capacitance of the charger is much lower than that of the motor controllers.</p><p>Second, the BMU must communicate to the charger over the CAN bus in order to set up the charging voltage and current. As mentioned on the charger page, there are two phases to charging, the constant current and constant voltage phase. To achieve constant voltage, the charger voltage is set to the desired fully charged voltage of the battery, which is equal to the fully charger voltage of each cell multiplied by the number of series connected cells. To achieve constant current, the current limit is set to the desired value for the constant current phase. For more information on the CAN communication, see the CAN specification document of the charger, attached below. As a minor detail, it is noted that for the 2020 car, the charger required a lower speed CAN bus than that of the rest of the car, so is on its own CAN bus connected to the BMU separate from that of the rest of the car.</p><p>Third, the BMU must balance the individual cells in the battery pack. Balancing means ensuring that the cells have the same voltage, as otherwise during the charging process it is possible that some cells increase in voltage more than others, and therefore have a different voltage. Balancing is important as if the cells have different voltage, some cells could be charged past their safe voltage limit, while others are still below the voltage limit and thus not fully charged. To balance the cells, the BMU uses the AMS boards and the LTC6811 chips on them to discharge cells that have a higher voltage. This is done through the use of discharge resistors present on the AMS board which can be connected across each of the cells on the AMS board. The balance algorithm for use during charging is as follows:</p><ol><li>Start charging with voltage and current limits set as described above</li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Pause ongoing balancing and read cell voltages and temperatures (pausing balancing is necessary as otherwise the balancing affects the voltage reading of cells that are discharging)</span></li><li>Resume paused balancing of cells and verify that cell voltages and temperatures are within their safe limits</li><li>If the minimum cell voltage is above the minimum voltage to start balancing, start checking if cells should be balanced (the minimum balance voltage is done to speed up charging at low cell voltages and to avoid over-discharging cells below their safe voltage limit)<ol><li>Get the state of charge (SoC) value of the cell with the minimum state of charge (SOC is explained below)</li><li>For each cell, if the cell SoC is more than 1% above the minimum SOC, balance the cell, otherwise don't balance the cell</li></ol></li><li>If the minimum SOC value is above 98%, and no cells are balancing, charging is finished. Otherwise, return to step 2</li></ol><p>As part of the balance process, the cells state of charge (SoC) is checked. The state of charge is <span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);">the level of charge of a battery </span><span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);">relative to its capacity. The units of SoC are percentage points (0% = empty; 100% = full) (taken from the wikipedia <a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_charge" rel="nofollow">page</a>). There are a number of ways to estimate the state of charge, but for the 2020 car we use the simple method of converting the voltage of the cell to the state of charge. A lookup table is created to convert from voltage to SoC. The range of safe voltages is divided into evenly spaced intervals, and then the cell voltage is used to index into the lookup table to get the SoC value. For example, with 10 lookup values, and safe voltage values from 3V to 3.9 V, the indices of the lookup table correspond to 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, ..., 3.9 V, and each lookup table value corresponds to the SoC at that index. This lookup table method allows for modelling the nonlinear relationship between voltage and SOC (the discharge curve). However, for simplicity a linear model is assumed for the 2020 car. In our example then, 3.0 V would be 0% SoC, and 3.4 V would be 50% SoC, and 3.9 V would be 100 % SoC. A possible area of future development would be to more accurately model the SoC (the wikipedia page outlines a few other method), and a simple start would be to create a non-linear lookup table.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="attachments/9528803896/9567702318.pdf" data-nice-type="PDF Document" data-file-src="/wiki/download/attachments/9528803896/Elcon%20CAN%20Specification%20(2).pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1588165665477&amp;cacheVersion=1&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="9567702318" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="9528803896" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Elcon CAN Specification (2).pdf" data-mime-type="application/pdf" data-has-thumbnail="true" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-media-id="5f99bf69-c616-4934-bedf-f4367c2c0680" data-media-type="file"><img src="attachments/thumbnails/9528803896/9567702318" height="250"/></a></span></p></div>
