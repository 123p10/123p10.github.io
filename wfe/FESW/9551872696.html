<p>Good version control forms the core of the firmware workflow. In order to use version control in an effective manner, we use <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">the gitflow git branch strategy.

<h1 id="FirmwareWorkflow(usingGit)-Branches">Branches</h1><p>The branches should follow the gitflow branch strategy (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow" rel="nofollow">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow</a>)</p><p>All branches should use the branch name scheme as follows: &lt;branch type&gt;/&lt;descriptive branch name&gt;. Branch type is one of the git flow branch types, and then it is up to you to choose a descriptive branch name.</p><p>The branch types are (see the gitflow link for more info on the types):</p><ul><li>bugfix/</li><li>feature/</li><li>hotfix/</li><li>release/</li></ul><p>The main branch types you'll likely use are bugfix and feature branches. They differ in what they are used for, the branches that they can be created off and merged into, and the branch name prefix</p><h3 id="FirmwareWorkflow(usingGit)-FeatureBranches">Feature Branches</h3><p>These branches are used to work on implementing new features to the codebase (as opposed to bugfixes, where you are making changes to an existing feature to fix an issue with it). They should only be branched off of the develop branch, and only merged back into the develop branch. As well, their branch name should be prefixed with feature/, for example the name could be feature/brake-light for working on implementing the brake light.</p><h3 id="FirmwareWorkflow(usingGit)-BugfixBranches">Bugfix Branches</h3><p>These branches are used to work on fixing bugs that affects existing code. They can be branched of either the develop branch, or a release branch, and back into either of those (normally the same branch that they are branched off of). As well, their branch name should be prefixed with bugfix/, for example the name could be bugfix/fix-brake-light for fixing a bug with the existing brake light code.</p></div>

<h1 id="FirmwareWorkflow(usingGit)-CommitMessages">Commit Messages</h1><p>All commit messages need to reference an issue that they are related too. Since a branch should be created for each new feature or bugfix, a commit should only ever be related to one issue. </p><h3 id="FirmwareWorkflow(usingGit)-WritingCommitMessages">Writing Commit Messages</h3><p>Check out this article by Tim Pope: <a class="external-link" href="https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html" rel="nofollow">https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html</a></p></div>

<h1 id="FirmwareWorkflow(usingGit)-PullRequests">Pull Requests</h1><p>Once you have finished you work on a bug/feature/etc in you branch, you will want to merge it into the develop branch. To do this, use a pull request on bitbucket. Navigate to the branches section of the Bitbucket repository, and select create pull request. Alternatively, when you push the branch to Bitbucket you will get a message with a link to create the pull request.</p><p>In filling out the pull request, try to fill in as much of the default template as possible. The mandatory fields are the title, summary, subject matter experts (should be at least you hopefully...), the description, and the testing done. If there are no relevant rules or confluence pages (maybe you should create one though?), its ok to put N/A. For reviewers, there should be a default reviewer added for the repository, optionally you can add more reviewers who you think should review your change. Finally, select close branch on merge.</p><p>The next step is to make sure you get approval for the pull request before you merge it. You need to get approval from at least one default reviewer before you merge the pull request. Once you have that, perform the merge (make sure Bitbucket doesn't give you a warning that there is merge conflict, if there are you need to fix those first).</p><p>Once the pull request is merged, you need to link the pull request in the relevant issue, see <a class="external-link" href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/mark-up-comments-305037452.html" rel="nofollow">https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/mark-up-comments-305037452.html</a> for how to do that, but basically just make a comment with test &quot;pull request # &lt;pull request number&gt;&quot; </p></div>
